## 📋 Complete Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. 📂 GitHub Repository Setup - Version Control Foundation

**Professional Repository Configuration:**

1. **Create New Repository:**
   - Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) and click "New Repository"
   - Name: `Website_Kandhari` (professional naming convention)
   - Visibility: Public (required for assignment demonstration)
   - Initialize with README.md for proper documentation

2. **Upload Complete Website Assets:**
   - `index.html` - Main website with semantic HTML structure
   - Embedded CSS for responsive design and professional styling
   - JavaScript for interactive functionality and Email.js integration
   - Image assets optimized for web performance
   - PDF resume for professional download functionality

**Technical Decision:** Single-file HTML approach chosen for easier server deployment and nano editor management within EC2 terminal environment.

### 2. ☁️ AWS EC2 Instance Configuration - Professional Cloud Infrastructure

#### Strategic Instance Selection:
Instance Type: t3.small (Enhanced performance over free tier)
AMI: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Long-term support for stability)
Storage: 30GB gp3 SSD (High performance, sufficient capacity)

#### Production Security Group Configuration:
Inbound Rules:
├── SSH (Port 22) ← My IP Only (Enhanced security)
├── HTTP (Port 80) ← 0.0.0.0/0 (Public web access)
└── HTTPS (Port 443) ← 0.0.0.0/0 (Secure web access)
Security Principles Applied:

Principle of least privilege (SSH restricted)
Defense in depth (Multiple security layers)
Fail-safe defaults (Only required ports open)


#### Elastic IP Assignment:
- **Allocated IP:** `54.66.64.231`
- **Purpose:** Static IP for DNS configuration and consistent access
- **Associated:** Linked to running EC2 instance for permanent assignment

### 🛠️ Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide
Professional System Administration Methodology:
Diagnostic Approach: Systematic problem identification, variable isolation, hypothesis testing, and solution implementation with proper documentation.

## 1. 🤖 Cron Job Automation Diagnostics
Symptom: Scripts execute manually but fail during scheduled cron execution.
Diagnostic Process:
Step 1: Verify Cron Configuration
## Display active cron jobs
```powershell
crontab -l
```
# Expected output:
```powershell
# 8 1 * * * /home/ubuntu/website_backup.sh
# */5 * * * * /home/ubuntu/github_auto_pull.sh
# 40 14 * * * /home/ubuntu/auto_update.sh
Step 2: Permission Analysis
bash# Check file permissions
ls -la /home/ubuntu/*.sh
```
###  Correct permissions should show:
```powershell
 -rwxr-xr-x (executable for all)
Step 3: Execution Logging
bash# Monitor cron execution
grep CRON /var/log/syslog | tail -n 10

 Expected successful output:

 CRON[PID]: (ubuntu) CMD (/home/ubuntu/script-name.sh)
```
Resolution:
```powershell
# Fix permissions definitively
sudo chmod +x /home/ubuntu/*.sh
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/*.sh
```
### 2. 🔐 SSH Authentication Management
Windows PowerShell Solution:
## Correct permission management for Windows
```powershell
icacls website.pem /inheritance:r /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"
```
## Verify connection
```powershell
ssh -i "website.pem" ubuntu@54.66.64.231
```
Advanced SSH Debugging:
## Verbose connection testing
```powershell
ssh -vvv -i "website.pem" ubuntu@54.66.64.231
